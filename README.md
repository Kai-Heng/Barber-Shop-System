# Barber-Shop-System

## Project Overview
This project will use Mbed libraries and C++ programming to implement a barber‐shop management system that optimizes the use of limited waiting‐area space. The goal is to coordinate how adult and child customers are admitted, seated, and assigned to barbers in a way that respects the shop’s constraints—three barbers (two for adults, one for children), eight available seats, and the rule that each child must be accompanied by one parent in the waiting area. The system must track the timing of haircuts (12 minutes plus a 1‐minute gap) as well as manage how and when customers leave the shop. Additionally, it must incorporate a procedure for an orderly evacuation if a fire alarm sounds. Ultimately, by ensuring smoother throughput and adherence to the space constraints, the project aims to increase sales and boost the barber shop’s overall efficiency.

The implementation was carried out on the Mbed simulator, with a focus on managing real-time events and resource constraints.

## Problem Statement
The barber shop struggles to handle different types of customers under strict physical limits and unique seating rules. Specifically, two adult‐only barbers and one child‐only barber need a reliable way to control customer flow. Children can only enter with a parent, and once they start a haircut, the child’s parent must stay until the child is finished—occupying a seat the entire time. With only eight total waiting spaces, the shop must prevent overcrowding at the door, avoid stalled barbers, and keep track of haircut durations and turnover times. Furthermore, there must be a clear, immediate plan to evacuate customers safely should a fire alarm trigger. The proposed system will address these challenges by tracking and scheduling customer entry, haircut operations, and exit flows, thereby ensuring optimal seat usage and improving the shop’s operational efficiency.
